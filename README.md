# Data Analysis and Model Development for Laptop and Car Pricing

### Project Overview
This repository contains various stages of data analysis and machine learning model development for pricing laptops and cars. The project involves data acquisition, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and model evaluation for both datasets (laptop and car pricing).

Contents
Data Acquisition

The process of gathering datasets for laptops and cars, including the sources and techniques used to acquire the data.
Data Wrangling

Laptops:
Cleaning and preparing laptop pricing data for analysis, including handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.
Cars:
Cleaning and preparing car pricing data similarly, ensuring it's ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Laptops:
In-depth analysis of laptop pricing data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.
Cars:
Similar analysis for car pricing, identifying key factors that influence car prices.
Model Development

Machine learning models were developed for both laptop and car pricing prediction, with details on the types of models used (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, etc.).
Model Evaluation

Performance evaluation of the developed models, including metrics like accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), and other relevant metrics for pricing prediction.
